# Intro

Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania and a Bachelor's degree in Informatics (Data Science Track) at the University of Washington, I bring a strong academic foundation in data science and systems engineering. My dual-degree background also includes psychology, enhancing my ability to approach challenges with a user-centered and analytical perspective. 

During my recent internship at Cisco, I contributed to developing integrated data foundations, delivering high-quality technical support, and improving business intelligence processes by implementing innovative AI-driven solutions. My core competencies in machine learning, PyTorch, and AWS fuel my passion for solving complex problems and driving impactful outcomes.
