# Intro

Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania and a Bachelor of Science in Informatics (Data Science Track) at the University of Washington. My background also includes a Bachelor of Art in Psychology, enhancing my ability to approach challenges with a user-centered perspective.

During my recent Data Engineering Internship at Cisco, I built a multi-agent AI orchestration system that cut SQL workflow runtime by 80% and reduced query latency from 20s to 3s. My core competencies in machine learning, PyTorch, and AWS fuel my passion for solving complex problems and driving impactful outcomes.

# What I enjoy
- Working with data and machine learning
- Building backend systems and optimizing databases
- Cloud technologies, especially AWS
- Computer vision and natural language processing research
- Creating solutions that actually help people
