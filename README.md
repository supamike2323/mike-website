# Mike Deng's Portfolio (Undertale Edition)

A personal portfolio website reimagined with a retro **Undertale** aesthetic. Built with modern web technologies, this site combines nostalgic pixel art vibes with smooth, responsive performance.

## 🌟 Features

- **Undertale Theme**: Authentic UI elements including dialog boxes, the "determination" heart cursor, and battle interfaces.
- **Interactive Battle Menu**: Navigate through the site (Projects, About, Resume, Contact) using a gamified menu system.
- **Inventory System**: View projects as items in an RPG inventory with detailed inspection views.
- **Dynamic Animations**: Custom typewriter effects, soul trait animations, and a starry background.
- **Pixel Perfect**: Integrated `VT323` and `Press Start 2P` fonts for that authentic 8-bit look.
